          Happy birthday 🥳🎂🥳 chanda, the day you came into my life I was not really much attached to you, but day by day you became close to my heart. And now you are truly my younger sister. I wish I could remove some of the pain from your life which you are bearing alone. But you're always welcome 🤗 you can talk anytime you want to talk, especially those things which you can't say to others. And this year may all your dreams come true. I wish that your brother could wish you — but if he couldn't, on his behalf I am wishing you Happy Birthday 🎈🎂🎈 Sana. Don't be sad okay? Be happy 😊
